# Materials for DSE 2024: Kim Ruhl

Lecture 13 // Thursday, August 8 // 13:00&ndash;14:20

**Status:** (7/30/2024) Readings are posted. Slides and code in the works...

Hello! This repo will (eventually) contain all of the materials related to my presentation. 

## Readings
The lecture is largely based around Alessandria, Arkolakis, and Ruhl (*Annual Review of Economics*, 2021). It provides an overview of how models of firm dynamics are used in international trade/macro. 

I have also added Alessandria, Choi, and Ruhl (*Journal of International Economics*, 2021) which provides a more in-depth study of the aggregate implications of modeling firms in international trade. We will not cover this in the presentation, but you might find it useful. 

Readings can be found in the "readings" folder in this repo.

## Slides
I will try to upload the presentation slides at least 24 hours before the presentation. You can find them in the "slides" folder. 

## Code
I am fortunate to have [Xing Xu](https://github.com/2xu2) working with me on various projects. He is putting together some jupyter notebooks (in Julia) that walk us through some of the models. This code will be available in the "code" folder in this repo.
