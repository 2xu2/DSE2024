# Lecture 19: Endogenous grid point methods (EGM and DCEGM)

**Saturday, August 9** // 14:30&ndash;15:50

Endogenous gridpoint method for models with continuous choice (EGM), and discrete-continuous choice (DCEGM)

### EGM in simple settings
- Deterministic consumption-savings model
- Detailed step-by-step video [https://youtu.be/MZ0MmprYMQo](https://youtu.be/MZ0MmprYMQo)
- Jupyter Notebook with Python implementation [https://github.com/fediskhakov/CompEcon/blob/main/41_egm.ipynb](https://github.com/fediskhakov/CompEcon/blob/main/41_egm.ipynb), also in the `code/python` directory
- A full list of videos including background on solving consumption-savings model [https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon](https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon)

### EGM in more involved settings
- Stochastic consumption-savings model
- Implementation of the EGM solver in the stochastic Deaton model [https://youtu.be/l3tNEh1Q-HQ](https://youtu.be/l3tNEh1Q-HQ)
- Background on the previously written code that is used in the video [https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon](https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon)
- Jupyter Notebook with Python implementation [https://github.com/fediskhakov/CompEcon/blob/main/42_egm_code.ipynb](https://github.com/fediskhakov/CompEcon/blob/main/42_egm_code.ipynb), also in the `code/python` directory

### Matlab implementation of EGM and DCEGM
- Lecture code in available in the `code/matlab` directory
- Full Matlab implementation repository is available at [https://github.com/fediskhakov/dcegm](https://github.com/fediskhakov/dcegm)
